# Data_Drift_and_Data_Decay_Tracker

This project addresses a common and critical issue in machine learning: data drift and model decay. Data drift occurs when the statistical properties of input data change over time, causing AI model performance to deteriorate. The project develops a dynamic Power BI dashboard that monitors data drift and model decay, quantifies their impact on business KPIs, and visualizes trends across products, regions, and time periods.

## Problem Statement

â€¢ Machine learning models degrade in performance when data distributions change, leading to:
  1) Declining prediction accuracy and reliability
  2) Loss of revenue and profit due to poor decision-making
  3) Reduced customer satisfaction
  4) The dashboard provides actionable intelligence to detect drift early, highlight model decay, and connect these issues to business outcomes.

## Tools & Technologies used

  1) Power Query within Power BI for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes including data cleaning and integration
  2) Microsoft Power BI 2024 for interactive dashboard creation using advanced DAX calculations

## Scope of Analysis

  1) Continuous monitoring of data drift and model decay trends
  2) Linking drift effects directly to key business KPIs such as profit and sales
  3) Supporting informed decision-making for retraining models and corrective actions to maintain accuracy and performance

## Conclusion

The Data Drift and Data Decay Tracker provides an effective, interactive platform for monitoring model health and business impact. Leveraging Excel for preprocessing, Power Query for data integration, and Power BI for visualization, this project transforms raw data into meaningful insights, enabling both technical teams and business stakeholders to anticipate and mitigate the adverse effects of model degradation.
